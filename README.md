You can access this on [Arweave](https://arweave.net/lUMRq4rTuRHd8Jy00JTP4UQVtGuJn90qA3mdbIfHc1s).

I have ported KyberSwap to Arweave. As part of [Port a dApp UI to Arweave](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/Bounties/issues/28) bounty. I made some modifications on KyberSwap to make it compatible with Arweave command line tool.

## Criteria

  - [x] There is no UI issues on this dApp UI.

* You need to add the permaweb dApp to http://arweaveapps.com on the platformsâ€™ category. Right now we have ETH dapps and EOS dapps available.
  - [x] I've added it to http://arweaveapps.com as KyberSwap.

  - [x] This isn't a high-risk or gambling dApp UI.
